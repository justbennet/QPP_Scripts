# QPP_Scripts: Demonstration for Keilholz Lab

This is what a typical GitHub repository would look like.  It's very
much like the directory structure.  As you make changes to individual
files, just the changes get saved to Git, and thence to GitHub.

You can, if you want to get 'advanced', create name 'Releases' of
your scripts, which can then be downloaded as they were at the
time of creation forever after.

Organizing things in this fashion also enables people to easily
browse the files without downloading at all.  They can also
make their own copy, perhaps correct a couple of typos, or
supply a missing semicolon, then send just those changes to
you via a 'pull request', which you can then discuss, and
finally accept to your code in one step without having to
retype.

There is also a way to make nicely formatted documentation
using GitHub that can be kept and versioned just like the
code.

In any event, this is just a demonstration to show you what it
might look like.  I hope it is informative and helpful.
